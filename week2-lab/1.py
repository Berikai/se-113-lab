# Create a Python project in which you have the following file: myFirstLabScript.py. This file
# will be your first Python script (also called a Python program or Python source code) that
# asks the userâ€™s name, and then greets the user. After that, the program will ask the user to
# enter his/her student id. Lastly, it will print the id also.

print("Hello, " + name + ".")
