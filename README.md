# SE 113 (2023-2024 Spring) - Python Course Lab Scripts

A repository for all the python scripts I've written in lab hours of the lecture SE 113, at Izmir University of Economics.

## Repository Structure

- Instructions in **.pdf** format can be found in [**instructions**](./instructions/) directory.
- **LAB0.pdf** corresponds to *1st week*, **LAB1.pdf** corresponds to *2nd week* and so on...
    - In essence, the naming is as follows: LAB **x** .pdf --> week **(x+1)** -lab
- Scripts of every week seperated into two (or three) directories.
    - **Example:** week1-lab, week1-homework
- [**fun**](./fun/) directory contains funny scripts that I've written out of boredom.
